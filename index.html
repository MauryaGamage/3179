                <h3>Understanding Estimated Cost of Living</h3>
                <p>The world map chart above provides a visual representation of the estimated cost of living in various cities around the globe. This estimation is derived from a calculation that takes into account several key factors relevant to daily life.</p>
                <p>To arrive at the estimated cost of living for each city, a specific equation is applied. This equation includes a selection of factors commonly considered when calculating the cost of living. These factors have different weights based on their relative importance in the overall estimation. The equation for estimating the cost of living is as follows:</p>
                <p><strong>Estimated Cost of Living = (0.30 * Housing) + (0.20 * Food) + (0.10 * Transportation) + (0.10 * Utilities) + (0.05 * Entertainment) + (0.10 * Healthcare) + (0.15 * Education)</strong></p>
                <p>Let's break down the components of this equation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> This factor accounts for the cost of renting a 1-bedroom apartment in the city center.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food:</strong> It considers the cost of a meal for 2 people at a mid-range restaurant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> This part takes into consideration the cost of a one-way ticket for local transport.</li>
                    <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> It reflects the cost of basic utilities for an 85m2 apartment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> It includes the cost of a cinema ticket.</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> It considers the cost of healthcare, including doctor's visits, medication, and more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Education:</strong> This accounts for the cost of preschool or primary school for a child.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These factors are assigned specific weights in the equation, reflecting their relative significance when calculating the cost of living. By assigning weights in this manner, the estimation becomes a weighted average of these factors, providing a comprehensive view of the cost of living in each city.</p>
                <p>The world map chart helps us visualize how these estimated costs of living vary from one city to another, offering valuable insights for individuals planning to relocate or plannning a trip to make informed decisions about their financial future.</p>
                <p>Please note that this is a simplified estimation, and real-world cost of living calculations may involve more factors and a more complex modeling approach. Additionally, actual living costs can vary based on individual circumstances and lifestyle choices.</p>
